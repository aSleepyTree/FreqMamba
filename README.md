 # FreqMamba
 Code of the paper accepted by ACM MM 2024: FreqMamba: Viewing Mamba from a Frequency Perspective for Image Deraining.

 Some files are not collated and I will sort them out gradually.

 This project is based on [[Mamba]](https://github.com/state-spaces/mamba), [[MambaIR]](https://github.com/csguoh/MambaIR), and [[LocalMamba]](https://github.com/hunto/LocalMamba), thanks for the excellent works.
